                            There was a time in our generation's lifetime when books did not have to compete with the hyper-rewarding, dopamine-triggering, instantly gratifying digital entertainment options available today. Even if there are few moments of quiet available - say, just standing in the checkout line at a grocery store - I find the urge to check my phone for notifications, and if there are none, "entertainment" is an easy click away - checking news, stock prices, social media, games - pick your poison!

                       We evolved shorter intestines over millions of years as we learnt to cook our food. It is hypothesized that shorter intestines are energy-efficient, allowing the energy to be redirected to our brains, and larger brains became possible. We literally sacrificed a part of our body for our brains, and what is the point if we don't appreciate and use it for the gift that it is? Technology, starting with the discovery of fire, led us to atrophied muscles. Will smarter machines (smartphones, generative AI, etc.) which can ease our cognitive loads lead to atrophied minds?

                    <p>
                        Regardless of whether we need to read more books because will effectively substitute a harmful form of entertainment (smartphones) for a benign one, or allow for some deep thinking (frankly, shallow is fine too at this point), or lead to self-development, here's a list of books I'd wish to read (or in some cases, re-read).

                            Atomic Habits by James Clear book is a popular best-seller. From the author's <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">website</a>, the book could help build and 
                            retain good habits not just for you but also your children (there seems to be a primer on how to apply Atomic Habits to parenting).

                        <p>
                            Sudha Murthy is a trailblazer - a computer engineer in the 70s, the first woman engineer hired at 
                            Tata Engineering and Locomotives Company - she wrote to the company's chairman after taking an issue with "men only" 
                            engineering positions (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudha_Murty">Sudha Murty - Wikipedia</a>), 
                            a prolific author having written 40+ books in three languages, a philanthropist, educator, wife of Narayan Murthy, 
                            whom she supported in founding Infosys and later became a chairperson of the company, mother-in-law to the current 
                            British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, and recipient of the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian award. 
                            She is a billionaire, but if you watch her interviews or read her columns, only her humility and brilliance shine through. 
                            <i>>Wise and Otherwise</i> is one of her earliest books, and a collection of stories that each drive a message and 
                            outline human nature (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wise_%26_Otherwise">Wise & Otherwise - Wikipedia</a>).

                        <h4 class="post-meta">Yuval Noah Harari</h4>
                        <p>
                            Yuval Noah Harari's <i>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</i> was an award-winning persistent best-seller. 
                            While the first book was about the past, <i>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</i> discusses current global issues ranging from 
                            loss of jobs due to technological advancement to international terrorism. As with Yuval Noah Harari's other books, 
                            this book was received mostly favorably but elucidated some criticisms (source: 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Lessons_for_the_21st_Century">21 Lessons for the 21st Century - Wikipedia</a>). 
                            While acknowledging that the content might not be perfect, it definitely will be thought-provoking, and consequently worth reading. 
                            I have had a copy of this book for a while and have not had the chance to read it completely, which I would very much like to do.

                        <p>
                            To say Steve Jobs was a visionary is wasting a sentence. He founded Apple, was fired from the company he founded, 
                            founded Pixar and Next computers, until he went back to Apple. Jobs' keynotes were legendary, as were his speeches 
                            (<a href="https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc?si=zm1FLK4Y6-fFPPXu">Stanford commencement speech</a>).
                            His interviews on product management are still relevant in a fast-paced world where things and ideas become obsolete 
                            so quickly. I understand the book is not without controversy - Jobs' family and friends disapprove of Jobs' portrayal 
                            (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_%28book%29">Steve Jobs (book) - Wikipedia</a>). 
                            But <i>Steve Jobs</i> by Walter Isaacson is the <em>authorized biography</em>. So, recognizing that the book might not be perfect, it is worth a read, nonetheless.

                        <p>
                            Love him or hate him, Elon Musk has had a significant impact on the world. As with the Steve Jobs biography, 
                            Walter Isaacson's portrayal of Musk in the book <i>Elon Musk</i> is not without a little bit of controversy (source: 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk_(Isaacson_book)">Elon Musk (Isaacson book) - Wikipedia</a>), 
                            but as with Jobs, Isaacson did follow Musk for a significant period of time and this book is an <em>authorized biography</em>.

                        <p>
                            Warren Buffet is one of the most successful investors of our times. Per him, <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>, by his guru Benjamin Graham, 
                            is one of the best books about investing! Need there be more said to motivate picking this book up?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, I have dabbled with stock trading using technical indicators - which aspiring data scientist worth 
                            their salt haven't tried applying statistical techniques and machine learning for stock predictions? More recently, 
                            I have come around to just investing in index funds. However, I am hopeful that <i>The Intelligent Investor</i> 
                            should offer insights into how to value a company in general, regardless of whether that is for evaluating the 
                            company's stock or the company itself.

                        <h3>Investments</h3>
                        <h4 class="post-meta">Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan J. Marcus, Pitabas Mohanty/h4>
                        <p>
                            The <i>Investments</i> textbook by Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan J. Marcus, and Pitabas Mohanty was a course textbook 
                            for an introductory finance course at the business school I attended. I have hung on to the textbook in the hopes 
                            that I'll one day do it justice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's a textbook, and hence covers a broad range of topics: different asset classes, how are securities traded, 
                            how do funds hedge against different types of risks, etc. My one takeaway from my first at reading the textbook 
                            back in the day - when most people (me included) think of "investments", the natural association that comes to mind 
                            is "stocks", and maybe "real estate" for some. This book should help switch from a mindset of specific asset classes 
                            to planning and evaluating a portfolio as a whole - not just from the perspective of return, but risk-adjusted return.
