                            There was a time in our generation's lifetime when books did not have to compete with the hyper-rewarding, dopamine-triggering, instantly gratifying digital entertainment options available today. Even if there are few moments of quiet available - say, just standing in the checkout line at a grocery store - I find the urge to check my phone for notifications, and if there are none, "entertainment" is an easy click away - checking news, stock prices, social media, games - pick your poison!

                       We evolved shorter intestines over millions of years as we learnt to cook our food. It is hypothesized that shorter intestines are energy-efficient, allowing the energy to be redirected to our brains, and larger brains became possible. We literally sacrificed a part of our body for our brains, and what is the point if we don't appreciate and use it for the gift that it is? Technology, starting with the discovery of fire, led us to atrophied muscles. Will smarter machines (smartphones, generative AI, etc.) which can ease our cognitive loads lead to atrophied minds?

                    <p>
                        Regardless of whether we need to read more books because will effectively substitute a harmful form of entertainment (smartphones) for a benign one, or allow for some deep thinking (frankly, shallow is fine too at this point), or lead to self-development, here's a list of books I'd wish to read (or in some cases, re-read).

                        <p>
                            Atomic Habits by James Clear book is a popular best-seller. From the author's <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">website</a>, the book could help build and 
                            retain good habits not just for you but also your children (there seems to be a primer on how to apply Atomic Habits to parenting).

                            Sudha Murthy is a trailblazer - a computer engineer in the 70s, the first woman engineer hired at 
                            Tata Engineering and Locomotives Company - she wrote to the company's chairman after taking an issue with "men only" 
                            engineering positions (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudha_Murty">Sudha Murty - Wikipedia</a>), 
                            a prolific author having written 40+ books in three languages, a philanthropist, educator, wife of Narayan Murthy, 
                            whom she supported in founding Infosys and later became a chairperson of the company, mother-in-law to the current 
                            British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, and recipient of the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian award. 
                            She is a billionaire, but if you watch her interviews or read her columns, only her humility and brilliance shine through. 
                            Wise and Otherwise is one of her earliest books, and a collection of stories that each drive a message and 
                            outline human nature (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wise_%26_Otherwise">Wise & Otherwise - Wikipedia</a>).

                        <h3>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</h3>
                        <h4 class="post-meta">Yuval Noah Harari</h4>
                        <p>
                            Yuval Noah Harari's <i>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</i> was an award-winning persistent best-seller. 
                            While the first book was about the past, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century discusses current global issues ranging from 
                            loss of jobs due to technological advancement to international terrorism. As with Yuval Noah Harari's other books, 
                            this book was received mostly favorably but elucidated some criticisms (source: <a href="">21 Lessons for the 21st Century - Wikipedia</a>). 
                            While acknowledging that the content might not be perfect, it definitely will be thought-provoking, and consequently worth reading. 
                            I have had a copy of this book for a while and have not had the chance to read it completely, which I would very much like to do.
