                            There was a time in our generation's lifetime when books did not have to compete with the hyper-rewarding, dopamine-triggering, instantly gratifying digital entertainment options available today. Even if there are few moments of quiet available - say, just standing in the checkout line at a grocery store - I find the urge to check my phone for notifications, and if there are none, "entertainment" is an easy click away - checking news, stock prices, social media, games - pick your poison!

                       We evolved shorter intestines over millions of years as we learnt to cook our food. It is hypothesized that shorter intestines are energy-efficient, allowing the energy to be redirected to our brains, and larger brains became possible. We literally sacrificed a part of our body for our brains, and what is the point if we don't appreciate and use it for the gift that it is? Technology, starting with the discovery of fire, led us to atrophied muscles. Will smarter machines (smartphones, generative AI, etc.) which can ease our cognitive loads lead to atrophied minds?

                        Imagine what would it have felt like to 20th century folks going about their lives. I'm sure life wasn't without hardships and the days were slow - but on both counts, I sometimes wonder if these are unequivocal downsides. I doubt 20th century folk had to exercise for the sake of exercise, or face problems arising from sedentary lifestyles. Besides lower stress and FOMO, they must have had the time to think things through in peace. Maybe I'm romanticizing "simpler" times.

                        Regardless of whether we need to read more books because will effectively substitute a harmful form of entertainment (smartphones) for a benign one, or allow for some deep thinking (frankly, shallow is fine too at this point), or lead to self-development, here's a list of books I'd wish to read (or in some cases, re-read).
